Problem Statement:

You are managing an inventory system for an e-commerce store.
The system maintains a list of products, each containing details such as product ID,
 name, category, price, stock quantity, and rating. You need to process this data
 using Java Streams.

 Todo:
 * Get a list of products that cost more than $100 and sort them in ascending order of price.
 * Find the total stock quantity of all products
 * Find the average price of products
 * Create a list of product names in uppercase.
 * Find the product with the highest rating
 * Find the most expensive product
 * Group products by their category and print them.
 * Partition products into two lists: those that are in stock and those that are out of stock
 * Use Optional to handle cases where rating is missing. If a product has no rating, assign a default value of 3.0.
 * Ensure that no NullPointerException occurs when stockQuantity is null.
 * Check if all products have a price greater than $10
 * Check if any product belongs to the "Electronics" category
extra:
 Implement exception handling  to avoid crashes when processing products with missing details.
